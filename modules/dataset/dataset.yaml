  This is an example of long
  text which describes the use of this dataset and
  whatever I want to annotate.
  
  You can also write multiple paragraphs with the only
  care of indenting them correctly.

# Array of class names (optional)
classes: [class_a, class_b, class_c]

# Array of features names (optional)
features: [feature_1, feature_2, feature_3, feature_4]

# Array of images
# images are listed as a couple of location (absolute or relative to this file location) and an optional label.
# location must be unique in the array
images:
# label can be a class name (string)...
# values can be an array with a positional correspondence with the features array...
  - location: image_path_and_name_1
    label: [class_b]
    values: [value_1, null, value_3, null]

# ... or the class index (integer) wrt the classes array
# ... or a dictionary with the name of the feature coupled with its value
  - location: image_path_and_name_2
    label: 2
    values: { feature_1: value_1, feature_3: value_3 }

# In the case of multi class problems, label can be an array of class names (array of strings)...
  - location: image_path_and_name_3
    label: [class_a, class_c]

# ... or an array of class indexes (array of integers)
  - location: image_path_and_name_4
    label: [0, 2]

# label can be a path (string) to an image in case of a segmentation task
  - location: image_path_and_name_5
    label: path_to_ground_truth_image

# Locations can also be an array of images with the same dimensions which must be merged into a single one...
  - location: [image_path_and_name_plane_1, image_path_and_name_plane_2, image_path_and_name_plane_3]
    label: 0

# Remember that labels are optional
  - location: image_path_and_name_6
  - location: image_path_and_name_7

# When only the location is used, it can be omitted
  - image_path_and_name_8
  - image_path_and_name_9
  - [image_path_and_name_plane_4, image_path_and_name_plane_5, image_path_and_name_plane_6, image_path_and_name_plane_7]

# Split (optional) is a dictionary with three arrays called
# training, validation, and test. They list the indexes of the images
# to be used in the three different phases.
split:
  training: [0, 1]
  validation: [2]
  test: [3]
